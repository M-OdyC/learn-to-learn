# Week 3, Pt.1 -> Procrastination 

Like a weightlifter builds muscle with day to day exercise, learning often involves day by day building of solid neural structures. And this is why tackling procrastination is so incredibly important.

## Zombies
Your habits put you on a semi-aware state in which you things almost automatically. That's how driving a car seems so trivial after practicing, and also is what make you jump into cycles of procrastination. 

## Planner journal
Keeping a planner journal is a good idea, so you can easily track when you reach your goals and observe what does and doesn't work. Commit yourself to certain **routines** and **tasks** each day. Write your planned tasks out the night before, so your brain has time to dwell on your goals and help ensure success.

## Rewards
Arrange your work into a series of small challenges. Always make sure you and your _zombies_ get lots of rewards. Take a few minutes to enjoy the feeling of happiness and triumph, which also gives your brain a chance to temporarily change modes (diffuse).
Deliberately delay rewards until you've finished a task.

## Procrastination cues
Try putting yourself in new surroundings with few procrastination cues.

## Trust
Gain trust in your system. You want to work hard during times of focused concentration and also to trust your system enough so that when it comes time to relax, you actually relax without the feelings of guilt or worry.

## Back up plans
Have back up plans for when you still procrastinate. No one is perfect after all.

## Eat your frogs first every day
Start the day with the more difficult or unpleasant task.
