# Week 1 -> What is learning?

The first week of the course focused on what is learning and how our brain tackles it.

## Modes of thinking
For a matter of simplicity, we can divide our modes of thinking in two:
* The **focused** mode, which took place when we are deeply concentrated in something that already has a "path" on our brain.
* The **diffuse** mode, which in turn took place when we are not deeply concentrated, and instead we have a more broad thinking. This could be like sleeping, jogging or relaxing.
Also, is a good idea to intercalate between those two modes to have a more efficient study.

## Procrastination
Everyone deals with procrastination. A very good way to tackle this problem is to use the **Pomodoro** technique.
The Pomodoro technique consists on getting rid of all distractions and study focused on the task for 25 minutes. Then, relax for a bit, and give yourself a reward.

## Repetition
Is through repetition that you'll remember what you studied. However, is not through overwhelmingly repeating. Instead, you should space your repetition over days and weeks.
There's known to be 4 slots of short time memory in the brain. The short memory acts like a not-so-good blackboard, while the long-term memory acts like an HD or storage.

## Sleep
Surprisingly or not, sleeping is not a waste of time after all. It helps your brain to build neural connections and wash away toxic substances.

## Exercising
Being in a rich environment and exercising are good ways to instigate your brain to build more neurons.
