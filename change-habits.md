# Transform Your Habits

This summary had been written after a detailed read of the 30 first pages of James Clear's Transform Your Habits. That's what I've learned:

## The common mistake to avoid
We usually overestimate the importance of a moment and underestimate what needs to be done to achieve it. The truth is that your life, and your success or failure, are determined not by a single moment, but by your daily basis habits.

## How habits works (3 R's)
The pattern of habits goes like this:
1. Reminder (the trigger that initiates the behavior)
2. Routine (the action you take)
3. Reward (the benefit from doing the behavior)

_
1. Therefore, to change your habits you'll need a trigger to remind you of the new habit. You should not rely on willpower, but new habits. 
So, use your current habits as a reminder of the new ones you want to have.
2. Another important step could be called "make it so easy you can't say no".  That is, make your new habit so easy to start that you can't say no.
3. And of course, always reward yourself, so you'll want to do it again. You can even tell something nice to yourself, like "good job!".

## How to stick to your goals for the long-term
In order to maintain your good habits and don't return to the bad ones, you'll have to create an identity for yourself, and try to stick to them. You can use your small wins to prove yourself that you are the person you wanted to be, you're following your identity.
Your life-change goals should be achieved through your habits.
Also, set a schedule, not a deadline.
And you can find a keystone habit, the habit that will drive all others habits and are both enjoyable and good for you.

## How to get back on track after slipping up
Make a calendar.
Stick to the schedule, even in small ways. Need to do less than is on schedule? It's ok, but do it anyways.
Have someone who expects something of you.
Design your environment for success

Also, you don't eliminate a bad habit. You replace it.
