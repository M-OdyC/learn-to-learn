# Week 4 -> Unlocking Your Potential

## Metaphors and analogies
One of the best things you can do to not only remember but more easily understand concepts in many different fields is to create a metaphor or analogy for them. Often, the more visual, the better. You can also put yourself in your metaphor.

## Change your thoughts
If you change your thoughts, you can really change your mind. It seems people can enhance the development of their neuronal circuits by practicing thoughts that use those neurons. For example, you can take pride in aiming for success because of the very things that make other people say you can't do it. 

## Use your brain wisely
Keep in mind that when you whiz through a homework or test question and don't go back to check your work, you're acting a little like a person who is refusing to use part of your brain. Revisit your work to see whether it makes sense.

## Team-up
Overconfidence in your results can result from using only one mode of thinking. By making it a point to do some of your studying with friends, you can more easily catch where your thinking has gone astray.

## Tests
Better rewatch the videos on this topic for more useful information, like the hard start jump to easy technique, breathing methods, etc.
