# Week 3, Pt.2 -> Memory

## Long-term memory
Practicing and repeating all in one day is a bad idea. You want to extend your practice to several days. This is also why tackling procrastination is important. It helps you built better memories. 

## Visual and spatial memory systems
We have outstanding visual and spatial memory systems. If you tap into those systems, it will help improve your memory.
To begin tapping into your visual memory system, try making a very memorable visual image representing one key item you want to remember. Beyond merely seeing, try to feel, to hear, and even to smell something you're trying to remember. The funnier and more evocative the image is, the better.
As always, repetition over several days is really helpful. 

## Grouping
Another key to memorization is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material. Try associating numbers with years or with systems you're familiar with like running times. Also, use mnemonics where is possible.

## Memory palace
The memory palace technique, placing memorable images in a scene that's familiar to you, allows you to dip into the strength of your visual memory system, providing a powerful way to grouping things you want to remember.
By making meaningful groups and abbreviations, you can simplify and chunk what you're trying to learn so you can more easily store it in memory.
