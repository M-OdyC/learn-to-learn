# Week 1 -> Chunking

Chunks are pieces of information, that are bound together through use and often through meaning. Chunks are best built with focused, undivided attention, understanding of the basic idea and practice.

## Recall
Simple recall, trying to remember the key points without looking at the page, is one of the best ways to help the chunking process along. Also, try recalling the material in places that are different from where you originally learned the material.

## Transfer
Is the idea that a chunk you've mastered in one area can often help you much more easily learn chunks of information in other areas.

## Interleave
Interleave your learning, by practicing your choice of different concepts, approach, and techniques all in one session. Chunks are important, but they don't build flexibility, which is also important to master a material.

## Illusions in learning
Learn to recognize when you're fooling yourself. Test yourself regularly. Mistakes are a good thing! And avoid practicing only the easy parts.

## Einstellung
Einstellung is when your initial thought, an idea you've already had in mind or an already developed neural pattern, prevents a better idea or solution from being found.

## Law of serendipity
Lady luck favors the one who tries.
