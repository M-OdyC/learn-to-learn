# Learning to Learn
This is my repository to take notes about the course Learning How to Learn, provided by University of California for free on Cousera. 

Just to challenge myself a little more, I'll write the notes in my yet no so good english.

By October of 2017, the course was available at this [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).
